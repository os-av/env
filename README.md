# env

My configuration files for a fresh Arch install. Includes dwm, st, dmenu,
slock and dwmblocks, along with other system configurations for vim and bash.

## Installation

Open directory and run the install script.

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Additional configuration

Vim will require some additional configuration, namely vim-plug which can be
found at https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.
